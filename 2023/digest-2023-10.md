FOG is a free open-source cloning/imaging/rescue suite/inventory management system. Prior to version 1.5.10.15, due to a lack of request sanitization in the logs, a malicious request containing XSS would be stored in a log file. When an administrator of the FOG server logged in and viewed the logs, they would be parsed as HTML and displayed accordingly. Version 1.5.10.15 contains a patch. As a workaround, view logs from an external text editor rather than the dashboard.

‚Äº CVE-2023-45672 ‚Äº

Frigate is an open source network video recorder. Prior to version 0.13.0 Beta 3, an unsafe deserialization vulnerability was identified in the endpoints used to save configurations for Frigate. This can lead to unauthenticated remote code execution. This can be performed through the UI at `/config` or through a direct call to `/api/config/save`. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a user's Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances: Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication); attacker knows the address of a user's Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized page which links to the user's Frigate instance; attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link. Input is initially accepted through `http.py`. The user-provided input is then parsed and loaded by `load_config_with_no_duplicates`. However, `load_config_with_no_duplicates` does not sanitize this input by merit of using `yaml.loader.Loader` which can instantiate custom constructors. A provided payload will be executed directly at `frigate/util/builtin.py:110`. This issue may lead to pre-authenticated Remote Code Execution. Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains a patch.

‚Äº CVE-2023-45867 ‚Äº

ILIAS (2013-09-12 release) contains a medium-criticality Directory Traversal local file inclusion vulnerability in the ScormAicc module. An attacker with a privileged account, typically holding the tutor role, can exploit this to gain unauthorized access to and potentially retrieve confidential files stored on the web server. The attacker can access files that are readable by the web server user www-data; this may include sensitive configuration files and documents located outside the documentRoot. The vulnerability is exploited by an attacker who manipulates the file parameter in a URL, inserting directory traversal sequences in order to access unauthorized files. This manipulation allows the attacker to retrieve sensitive files, such as /etc/passwd, potentially compromising the system's security. This issue poses a significant risk to confidentiality and is remotely exploitable over the internet.

‚Äº CVE-2023-45868 ‚Äº

The Learning Module in ILIAS 7.25 (2023-09-12 release) allows an attacker (with basic user privileges) to achieve a high-impact Directory Traversal attack on confidentiality and availability. By exploiting this network-based vulnerability, the attacker can move specified directories, normally outside the documentRoot, to a publicly accessible location via the PHP function rename(). This results in a total loss of confidentiality, exposing sensitive resources, and potentially denying access to the affected component and the operating system's components. To exploit this, an attacker must manipulate a POST request during the creation of an exercise unit, by modifying the old_name and new_name parameters via directory traversal. However, it's essential to note that, when exploiting this vulnerability, the specified directory will be relocated from its original location, rendering all files obtained from there unavailable.

‚Äº CVE-2023-45137 ‚Äº

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web` starting in version 3.1-milestone-2 and prior to version 13.4-rc-1, as well as `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates` prior to versions 14.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1, are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. When trying to create a document that already exists, XWiki displays an error message in the form for creating it. Due to missing escaping, this error message is vulnerable to raw HTML injection and thus XSS. The injected code is the document reference of the existing document so this requires that the attacker first creates a non-empty document whose name contains the attack code. This has been patched in `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web` version 13.4-rc-1 and `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates` versions 14.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1 by adding the appropriate escaping. The vulnerable template file `createinline.vm` is part of XWiki's WAR and can be patched by manually applying the changes from the fix.

While the function performs a nonce check, steps 2 and 3 of the check do not take any action upon a failed check. These steps then perform a 'file_exists' check on the value of 'zbscrmcsvimpf'. If a phar:// archive is supplied, its contents will be deserialized and an object injected in the execution stream. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to obtain object injection if they are able to upload a phar archive (for instance if the site supports image uploads) and then trick an administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a link.

‚Äº CVE-2023-43794 ‚Äº

Nocodb is an open source Airtable alternative. Affected versions of nocodb contain a SQL injection vulnerability, that allows an authenticated attacker with creator access to query the underlying database. By supplying a specially crafted payload to the given an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries to be executed. Since this is a blind SQL injection, an attacker may need to use time-based payloads which would include a function to delay execution for a given number of seconds. The response time indicates, whether the result of the query execution was true or false. Depending on the result, the HTTP response will be returned after a given number of seconds, indicating TRUE, or immediately, indicating FALSE. In that way, an attacker can reveal the data present in the database. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.111.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-141`.

dicourse-calendar is a plugin for the Discourse messaging platform which adds the ability to create a dynamic calendar in the first post of a topic. Improper escaping of event titles could lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) within the 'email preview' UI when a site has CSP disabled. Having CSP disabled is a non-default configuration, so the vast majority of sites are unaffected. This problem is resolved in the latest version of the discourse-calendar plugin. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure CSP is enabled on the forum.

com.xwiki.identity-oauth:identity-oauth-ui is a package to aid in building identity and service providers based on OAuth authorizations. When a user logs in via the OAuth method, the identityOAuth parameters sent in the GET request is vulnerable to cross site scripting (XSS) and XWiki syntax injection. This allows remote code execution via the groovy macro and thus affects the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. The issue has been fixed in Identity OAuth version 1.6. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability and users are advised to upgrade.

‚Äº CVE-2023-45683 ‚Äº

github.com/crewjam/saml is a saml library for the go language. In affected versions the package does not validate the ACS Location URI according to the SAML binding being parsed. If abused, this flaw allows attackers to register malicious Service Providers at the IdP and inject Javascript in the ACS endpoint definition, achieving Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) in the IdP context during the redirection at the end of a SAML SSO Flow. Consequently, an attacker may perform any authenticated action as the victim once the victim√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s browser loaded the SAML IdP initiated SSO link for the malicious service provider. Note: SP registration is commonly an unrestricted operation in IdPs, hence not requiring particular permissions or publicly accessible to ease the IdP interoperability. This issue is fixed in version 0.4.14. Users unable to upgrade may perform external validation of URLs provided in SAML metadata, or restrict the ability for end-users to upload arbitrary metadata.

‚Äº CVE-2023-44392 ‚Äº

Garden provides automation for Kubernetes development and testing. Prior tov ersions 0.13.17 and 0.12.65, Garden has a dependency on the cryo library, which is vulnerable to code injection due to an insecure implementation of deserialization. Garden stores serialized objects using cryo in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources prefixed with `test-result` and `run-result` to cache Garden test and run results. These `ConfigMaps` are stored either in the `garden-system` namespace or the configured user namespace. When a user invokes the command `garden test` or `garden run` objects stored in the `ConfigMap` are retrieved and deserialized. This can be used by an attacker with access to the Kubernetes cluster to store malicious objects in the `ConfigMap`, which can trigger a remote code execution on the users machine when cryo deserializes the object. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster used to deploy garden remote environments. Further, a user must actively invoke either a `garden test` or `garden run` which has previously cached results. The issue has been patched in Garden versions `0.13.17` (Bonsai) and `0.12.65` (Acorn). Only Garden versions prior to these are vulnerable. No known workarounds are available.

‚Äº CVE-2023-44393 ‚Äº

Piwigo is an open source photo gallery application. Prior to version 14.0.0beta4, a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is in the` /admin.php?page&#61;plugins&amp;tab&#61;new&amp;installstatus&#61;ok&amp;plugin_id&#61;[here]` page. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JS code into the HTML page, which could then be executed by admin users when they visit the URL with the payload. The vulnerability is caused by the insecure injection of the `plugin_id` value from the URL into the HTML page. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that contains a specially crafted `plugin_id` value. When a victim who is logged in as an administrator visits this URL, the malicious code will be injected into the HTML page and executed. This vulnerability can be exploited by any attacker who has access to a malicious URL. However, only users who are logged in as administrators are affected. This is because the vulnerability is only present on the `/admin.php?page&#61;plugins&amp;tab&#61;new&amp;installstatus&#61;ok&amp;plugin_id&#61;[here]` page, which is only accessible to administrators. Version 14.0.0.beta4 contains a patch for this issue.

AntiSamy is a library for performing fast, configurable cleansing of HTML coming from untrusted sources. Prior to version 1.7.4, there is a potential for a mutation XSS (mXSS) vulnerability in AntiSamy caused by flawed parsing of the HTML being sanitized. To be subject to this vulnerability the `preserveComments` directive must be enabled in your policy file and also allow for certain tags at the same time. As a result, certain crafty inputs can result in elements in comment tags being interpreted as executable when using AntiSamy's sanitized output. This issue has been patched in AntiSamy 1.7.4 and later.

Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. In some cases, when Gradle parses XML files, resolving XML external entities is not disabled. Combined with an Out Of Band XXE attack (OOB-XXE), just parsing XML can lead to exfiltration of local text files to a remote server. Gradle parses XML files for several purposes. Most of the time, Gradle parses XML files it generated or were already present locally. Only Ivy XML descriptors and Maven POM files can be fetched from remote repositories and parsed by Gradle. In Gradle 7.6.3 and 8.4, resolving XML external entities has been disabled for all use cases to protect against this vulnerability. Gradle will now refuse to parse XML files that have XML external entities.
