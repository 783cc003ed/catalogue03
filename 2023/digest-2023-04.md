‼ CVE-2023-30852 ‼

Pimcore is an open source data and experience management platform. Prior to version 10.5.21, the `/admin/misc/script-proxy` API endpoint that is accessible by an authenticated administrator user is vulnerable to arbitrary JavaScript and CSS file read via the `scriptPath` and `scripts` parameters. The `scriptPath` parameter is not sanitized properly and is vulnerable to path traversal attack. Any JavaScript/CSS file from the application server can be read by specifying sufficient number of `../` patterns to go out from the application webroot followed by path of the folder where the file is located in the &quot;scriptPath&quot; parameter and the file name in the &quot;scripts&quot; parameter. The JavaScript file is successfully read only if the web application has read access to it. Users should update to version 10.5.21 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, apply the patch manual.

‼ CVE-2023-2297 ‼

The Profile Builder â€“ User Profile &amp; User Registration Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized password resets in versions up to, and including 3.9.0. This is due to the plugin using native password reset functionality, with insufficient validation on the password reset function (wppb_front_end_password_recovery). The function uses the plaintext value of a password reset key instead of a hashed value which means it can easily be retrieved and subsequently used. An attacker can leverage CVE-2023-0814, or another vulnerability like SQL Injection in another plugin or theme installed on the site to successfully exploit this vulnerability.

‼ CVE-2023-30838 ‼

PrestaShop is an Open Source e-commerce web application. Prior to versions 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9, the `ValidateCore::isCleanHTML()` method of Prestashop misses hijackable events which can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) injection, allowed by the presence of pre-setup `@keyframes` methods. This XSS, which hijacks HTML attributes, can be triggered without any interaction by the visitor/administrator, which makes it as dangerous as a trivial XSS attack. Contrary to other attacks which target HTML attributes and are triggered without user interaction (such as onload / onerror which suffer from a very limited scope), this one can hijack every HTML element, which increases the danger due to a complete HTML elements scope. Versions 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9 contain a fix for this issue.

Dirty Vanity is a new code-injection technique that abuses forking, a lesser-known mechanism that exists in Windows operating systems. In this post, we will dive deep into forking, explore its legitimate use, and show how it can be manipulated into blind-sighting EDRs by injecting malicious code.

‼ CVE-2023-20030 ‼

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information, conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack through an affected device, or negatively impact the responsiveness of the web-based management interface itself. This vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of confidential information. A successful exploit could also cause the web application to perform arbitrary HTTP requests on behalf of the attacker or consume memory resources to reduce the availability of the web-based management interface. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Super Admin or Policy Admin credentials.

Автотекст: (RSTReportsAnalyser + ChatGPT + Google Translate|DeepL)

Основная идея: Rilide - это вредоносное расширение для браузера, замаскированное под легитимное расширение Google Drive, способное выполнять такие вредоносные действия, как мониторинг истории просмотров, создание скриншотов и кража средств с различных криптовалютных бирж. Он был распространен с помощью двух кампаний и является ярким примером растущей сложности вредоносных расширений для браузеров.
-----

Компания Trustwave SpiderLabs недавно обнаружила вредоносное расширение для браузера под названием Rilide, которое нацелено на браузеры на базе Chromium, такие как Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave и Opera. Rilide маскируется под легитимное расширение Google Drive и способен выполнять различные вредоносные действия, включая мониторинг истории просмотров, создание скриншотов и кражу средств с различных криптовалютных бирж. Вредоносная программа также использует поддельные диалоги, чтобы обманом заставить пользователей раскрыть свои коды двухфакторной аутентификации (2FA).

Rilide распространялся посредством двух кампаний. Первая представляла собой вредоносный файл Microsoft Publisher, который был частью Ekipa RAT, троянца удаленного доступа (RAT). Ekipa RAT часто продается на подпольных форумах, а Microsoft устранила недостаток безопасности в феврале 2023 года. Вторая кампания использовала кражу Aurora, которая представляет собой вредоносное ПО как услуга (MaaS), доступное на русскоязычных подпольных форумах. Aurora предназначен для получения данных из нескольких веб-браузеров, криптовалютных кошельков и локальных систем. Aurora также распространялась через кампании, выдававшие себя за законные программы установки Team Viewer и драйверов NVIDIA.

Полезная нагрузка сохранялась в каталоге %temp% с именем файла .exe, состоящим из 10 алфавитно-цифровых символов, и выполнялась с помощью команды start-process PowerShell. Полезная нагрузка была упакована с помощью VMProtect, коммерческого упаковщика, и содержала закодированный в base64 блоб данных, хранящий URL-адрес загрузчика Rilide на основе Rust. Этот загрузчик отвечал за установку расширения Rilide для браузеров на базе Chromium.

Rilide использует несколько встроенных функций хрома для проведения XSS-атаки и загрузки внешних ресурсов. Он может перехватывать URL-адреса из текущего домена, захватывать и перехватывать скриншоты активных вкладок, а также заменять подтверждения электронной почты запросами авторизации с устройства, когда пользователь заходит в почтовый ящик через тот же веб-браузер. Более того, он поддерживает функцию автоматического вывода средств, которая обманом заставляет пользователя предоставить код авторизации.

Похожие расширения были обнаружены в объявлениях о продаже, а исходный код был недавно утечен на подпольном форуме из-за спора об оплате. Обращение к домену командно-административного управления ashgrrwt.click привело к дополнительным загрузчикам Rilide, связанным с пользователем GitHub gulantin.

Rilide является ярким примером растущей сложности вредоносных расширений браузера и потенциальной опасности, которую они представляют. Несмотря на то, что предстоящее введение в действие манифеста v3 может усложнить деятельность угрожающих субъектов, важно сохранять бдительность и скептицизм при получении незапрашиваемых электронных писем или сообщений, а также оставаться в курсе последних угроз кибербезопасности и лучших практик.

‼ CVE-2023-28836 ‼

Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Starting in version 1.5 and prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists on ModelAdmin views within the Wagtail admin interface. A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin could potentially craft pages and documents that, when viewed by a user with higher privileges, could perform actions with that user's credentials. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin, and only affects sites with ModelAdmin enabled. For page, the vulnerability is in the &quot;Choose a parent page&quot; ModelAdmin view (`ChooseParentView`), available when managing pages via ModelAdmin. For documents, the vulnerability is in the ModelAdmin Inspect view (`InspectView`) when displaying document fields. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2. Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can disable or override the corresponding functionality.
