GoCD is an open source continuous delivery server. GoCD versions before 23.1.0 are vulnerable to a stored XSS vulnerability, where pipeline configuration with a malicious pipeline label configuration can affect browser display of pipeline runs generated from that configuration. An attacker that has permissions to configure GoCD pipelines could include JavaScript elements within the label template, causing a XSS vulnerability to be triggered for any users viewing the Value Stream Map or Job Details for runs of the affected pipeline, potentially allowing them to perform arbitrary actions within the victim's browser context rather than their own. This issue has been fixed in GoCD 23.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Pluck CMS is vulnerable to an authenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability through its â€œalbumsâ€� module. Albums are used to create collections of images that can be inserted into web pages across the site. Albums allow the upload of various filetypes, which undergo a normalization process before being available on the site. Due to lack of file extension validation, it is possible to upload a crafted JPEG payload containing an embedded PHP web-shell. An attacker may navigate to it directly to achieve RCE on the underlying web server. Administrator credentials for the Pluck CMS web interface are required to access the albums module feature, and are thus required to exploit this vulnerability.

Автотекст: (RSTReportsAnalyser + ChatGPT + Google Translate|DeepL)

Поток атак ProxyNotShell, впервые обнаруженный в конце 2021 года, остается постоянной угрозой для серверов Microsoft Exchange. Эксплойт использует подделку запросов на стороне сервера (SSRF) для удаленного выполнения кода (RCE) и похож на печально известную атаку ProxyShell в 2021 году. В ответ на это Microsoft выпустила исправление, направленное на устранение двух уязвимостей, которые могли быть использованы ProxyNotShell в ноябре 2022 года. Однако с тех пор злоумышленники смогли обойти патч, что привело к росту активности угроз, пытающихся распространить вымогательское ПО. Sophos X-Ops, CrowdStrike и HuntressLabs наблюдали подобные атаки с использованием техники OWASRF, а также закодированных команд PowerShell, инструментов разведки, BITSAdmin для передачи файлов, попыток установки агентов двойного назначения и включения удаленных соединений. Вредоносное ПО, используемое злоумышленниками, включает DirtyMoe и komar.dll, а устаревшие серверы остаются уязвимыми к эксплойту даже после выпуска исправления. Организациям следует принять меры по обеспечению актуальности и безопасности своих серверов Exchange для предотвращения успешной атаки ProxyNotShell.

‼ CVE-2023-26487 ‼

Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs.`lassoAppend' function accepts 3 arguments and internally invokes `push` function on the 1st argument specifying array consisting of 2nd and 3rd arguments as `push` call argument. The type of the 1st argument is supposed to be an array, but it's not enforced. This makes it possible to specify any object with a `push` function as the 1st argument, `push` function can be set to any function that can be access via `event.view` (no all such functions can be exploited due to invalid context or signature, but some can, e.g. `console.log`). The issue is that`lassoAppend` doesn't enforce proper types of its arguments. This issue opens various XSS vectors, but exact impact and severity depends on the environment (e.g. Core JS `setImmediate` polyfill basically allows `eval`-like functionality). This issue was patched in 5.23.0.

‼ CVE-2023-22462 ‼

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. On 2023-01-01 during an internal audit of Grafana, a member of the security team found a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin &quot;Text&quot;. The stored XSS vulnerability requires several user interactions in order to be fully exploited. The vulnerability was possible due to React's render cycle that will pass though the unsanitized HTML code, but in the next cycle the HTML is cleaned up and saved in Grafana's database. An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a Text panel to include JavaScript. Another user needs to edit the same Text panel, and click on &quot;Markdown&quot; or &quot;HTML&quot; for the code to be executed. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard. This issue has been patched in versions 9.2.10 and 9.3.4.

‼ CVE-2023-26046 ‼

teler-waf is a Go HTTP middleware that provides teler IDS functionality to protect against web-based attacks. In teler-waf prior to version 0.1.1 is vulnerable to bypassing common web attack rules when a specific HTML entities payload is used. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and compromise the security of the web application. The vulnerability exists due to teler-waf failure to properly sanitize and filter HTML entities in user input. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass common web attack threat rules in teler-waf and launch cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and steal sensitive information, such as login credentials and session tokens, or take control of the victim's browser and perform malicious actions. This issue has been fixed in version 0.1.1.

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Starting with the 8.1 branch, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin GeoMap. The stored XSS vulnerability was possible due to map attributions weren't properly sanitized and allowed arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the context of the currently authorized user of the Grafana instance. An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a panel to include a map attribution containing JavaScript. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard. Users may upgrade to version 8.5.21, 9.2.13 and 9.3.8 to receive a fix.
