‼ CVE-2022-4696 ‼

There exists a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through io_uring and the IORING_OP_SPLICE operation. If IORING_OP_SPLICE is missing the IO_WQ_WORK_FILES flag, which signals that the operation won't use current-&gt;nsproxy, so its reference counter is not increased. This assumption is not always true as calling io_splice on specific files will call the get_uts function which will use current-&gt;nsproxy leading to invalidly decreasing its reference counter later causing the use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading to version 5.10.160 or above

TLS Poison

A tool that allows for generic SSRF via TLS, as well as CSRF via image tags in most browsers. The goals are similar to SNI injection, but this new method uses inherent behaviors of TLS, instead of depending upon bugs in a particular implementation.

Lots of people try to attack the security of TLS. But what if we use TLS to attack other things? It's a huge standard, and it turns out that features intended to make TLS fast have also made it useful as an attack vector.

Among other things, these features provide a lot of flexibility for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). While past work using HTTPS URLs in SSRF has relied upon platform-specific bugs such as SNI injection, we can go further. In this talk, I present a novel, cross-platform way of leveraging TLS to target internal services.

Uniquely, these attacks are more effective the more comprehensively a platform supports modern TLS, so won't go away with library upgrades. It is also unlikely that the TLS spec will change overnight at the whim of a random security researcher. Instead, we need to walk through scenarios and dispel common assumptions so the audience can know what to look out for. Of course, the best way to do so is with demos!

Dear DoD - Team, I am able to execute javascript code on www. ███████/News/Speeches. This endpoint has a search functionality with the parameter Search. The supplied value to this parameter gets embedded into the website. Furthermore the frontend of the website is presumably created with a template engine. These engines handle user supplied data within double curly braces {{...}} for example. If the user input is not sanitized corretly template injection can occur. When supplying the Search parameter with a value inside double curly braces it gets evaluated and the result is then embedded into the web page. For example the search value www. ███████/News/Speeches?Search&#61;{{7*7}} gets evaluated to 49 and put into the web page (see image_1.png). Besides simple mathematical equations, javascript code can be put inside those braces too (see image_2.png). This will execute the code as well which results in a XSS vulnerability. There are some mitigations to this. For example some methods are blacklisted which means alert(1)…

When using the payload &lt;select&gt;&lt;style&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;XSS&quot;)&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/select&gt; for the parameter I got an alert no matter what the version of rails-html-sanitizer was.

<blockquote>
‼ CVE-2023-22461 ‼

The `sanitize-svg` package, a small SVG sanitizer to prevent cross-site scripting attacks, uses a deny-list-pattern to sanitize SVGs to prevent XSS. In doing so, literal `&lt;script&gt;`-tags and on-event handlers were detected in versions prior to 0.4.0. As a result, downstream software that relies on `sanitize-svg` and expects resulting SVGs to be safe, may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability was addressed in v0.4.0. There are no known workarounds

Summary: Hi consensys Security Team. I have found CSV Injection when generate report at https://assets-paris-demo.codefi.network/ CSV Injection, also known as Formula Injection, occurs when websites embed untrusted input inside CSV files. When a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc is used to open a CSV, any cells starting with &#61; will be interpreted by the software as a formula. Maliciously crafted formulas can be used for three key attacks: - Hijacking the user’s computer by exploiting vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software, such as CVE-2014-3524. - Hijacking the user’s computer by exploiting the user’s tendency to ignore security warnings in spreadsheets that they downloaded from their own website. - Exfiltrating contents from the spreadsheet, or other open spreadsheets.  Steps To Reproduce:  Create an account at https://assets-paris-demo.codefi.network/  Go to Client management Create new client  At Client name* Put this paylaod:- &#61;cmd|' /C notepad'!'A1' After create new client…

🛠 SQLMAP - Automatic SQL Injection Tool 1.7 🛠

sqlmap is an open source command-line automatic SQL injection tool. Its goal is to detect and take advantage of SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. Once it detects one or more SQL injections on the target host, the user can choose among a variety of options to perform an extensive back-end database management system fingerprint, retrieve DBMS session user and database, enumerate users, password hashes, privileges, databases, dump entire or user's specified DBMS tables/columns, run his own SQL statement, read or write either text or binary files on the file system, execute arbitrary commands on the operating system, establish an out-of-band stateful connection between the attacker box and the database server via Metasploit payload stager, database stored procedure buffer overflow exploitation or SMB relay attack and more.

<blockquote>
‼ CVE-2022-34323 ‼

Multiple XSS issues were discovered in Sage XRT Business Exchange 12.4.302 that allow an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. The attacker needs to be authenticated to reach the vulnerable features. An issue is present in the Filters and Display model features (OnlineBanking &gt; Web Monitoring &gt; Settings &gt; Filters / Display models). The name of a filter or a display model is interpreted as HTML and can thus embed JavaScript code, which is executed when displayed. This is a stored XSS. Another issue is present in the Notification feature (OnlineBanking &gt; Configuration &gt; Notifications and alerts &gt; Alerts *). The name of an alert is interpreted as HTML, and can thus embed JavaScript code, which is executed when displayed. This is a stored XSS. (Also, an issue is present in the File download feature, accessible via /OnlineBanking/cgi/isapi.dll/DOWNLOADFRS. When requesting to show the list of downloadable files, the contents of three form fields are embedded in the JavaScript code without prior sanitization. This is essentially a self-XSS.)

‼ CVE-2022-34322 ‼

Multiple XSS issues were discovered in Sage Enterprise Intelligence 2021 R1.1 that allow an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of users' browsers. The attacker needs to be authenticated to reach the vulnerable features. An issue is present in the Notify Users About Modification menu and the Notifications feature. A user can send malicious notifications and execute JavaScript code in the browser of every user who has enabled notifications. This is a stored XSS, and can lead to privilege escalation in the context of the application. (Another issue is present in the Favorites tab. The name of a favorite or a folder of favorites is interpreted as HTML, and can thus embed JavaScript code, which is executed when displayed. This is a self-XSS.)
