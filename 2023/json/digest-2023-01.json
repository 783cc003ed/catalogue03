Starting with the 8.1 branch and prior to versions 8.5.16, 9.2.10, and 9.3.4, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin GeoMap. The stored XSS vulnerability was possible because SVG files weren't properly sanitized and allowed arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the context of the currently authorized user of the Grafana instance. An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a panel to include either an external URL to a SVG-file containing JavaScript, or use the `data:` scheme to load an inline SVG-file containing JavaScript. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard. Users may upgrade to version 8.5.16, 9.2.10, or 9.3.4 to receive a fix.\n\n📖 Read\n\nvia \"National Vulnerability Database\"."

Versions prior to 1.0.0 are vulnerable to Code injection. This issue affects anyone who is using the default presets and/or does not handle the functionality themself. This issue has been partially mitigated in version 1.0.0, with the maintainer's GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) noting \"It is impossible to fully guard against this, because users have access to the original raw information. However, as of version 1, if you only access the constrained models, you will not encounter this issue. Further similar situations are NOT seen as a security issue, but intended behavior.\" The suggested workaround from the maintainers is \"Fully custom presets that change the entire rendering process which can then escape the user input.\"\n\n📖 Read\n\nvia \"National Vulnerability Database\"."

The goals are similar to SNI injection, but this new method uses inherent behaviors of TLS, instead of depending upon bugs in a particular implementation.\n\nhttps://github.com/jmdx/TLS-poison",
    "webpage_description": "Lots of people try to attack the security of TLS. But what if we use TLS to attack other things? It's a huge standard, and it turns out that features intended to make TLS fast have also made it useful as an attack vector.\n\nAmong other things, these features provide a lot of flexibility for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). While past work using HTTPS URLs in SSRF has relied upon platform-specific bugs such as SNI injection, we can go further. In this talk, I present a novel, cross-platform way of leveraging TLS to target internal services.\n\nUniquely, these attacks are more effective the more comprehensively a platform supports modern TLS, so won't go away with library upgrades. It is also unlikely that the TLS spec will change overnight at the whim of a random security researcher. Instead, we need to walk through scenarios and dispel common assumptions so the audience can know what to look out for. Of course, the best way to do so is with demos!",

These engines handle user supplied data within double curly braces {{...}} for example. If the user input is not sanitized corretly template injection can occur. When supplying the Search parameter with a value inside double curly braces it gets evaluated and the result is then embedded into the web page.
