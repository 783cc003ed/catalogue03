Эксплойт использует подделку запросов на стороне сервера (SSRF) для удаленного выполнения кода (RCE) и похож на печально известную атаку ProxyShell в 2021 году. В ответ на это Microsoft выпустила исправление, направленное на устранение двух уязвимостей, которые могли быть использованы ProxyNotShell в ноябре 2022 года. Однако с тех пор злоумышленники смогли обойти патч, что привело к росту активности угроз, пытающихся распространить вымогательское ПО. Sophos X-Ops, CrowdStrike и HuntressLabs наблюдали подобные атаки с использованием техники OWASRF, а также закодированных команд PowerShell, инструментов разведки, BITSAdmin для передачи файлов, попыток установки агентов двойного назначения и включения удаленных соединений. Вредоносное ПО, используемое злоумышленниками, включает DirtyMoe и komar.dll, а устаревшие серверы остаются уязвимыми к эксплойту даже после выпуска исправления. Организациям следует принять меры по обеспечению актуальности и безопасности своих серверов Exchange для предотвращения успешной атаки ProxyNotShell."

    "message": "‼ CVE-2023-22462 ‼\n\nGrafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. On 2023-01-01 during an internal audit of Grafana, a member of the security team found a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin \"Text\". The stored XSS vulnerability requires several user interactions in order to be fully exploited. The vulnerability was possible due to React's render cycle that will pass though the unsanitized HTML code, but in the next cycle the HTML is cleaned up and saved in Grafana's database. An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a Text panel to include JavaScript. Another user needs to edit the same Text panel, and click on \"Markdown\" or \"HTML\" for the code to be executed. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard. This issue has been patched in versions 9.2.10 and 9.3.4.\n\n📖 Read\n\nvia \"National Vulnerability Database\"."

In teler-waf prior to version 0.1.1 is vulnerable to bypassing common web attack rules when a specific HTML entities payload is used. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and compromise the security of the web application. The vulnerability exists due to teler-waf failure to properly sanitize and filter HTML entities in user input. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass common web attack threat rules in teler-waf and launch cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and steal sensitive information, such as login credentials and session tokens, or take control of the victim's browser and perform malicious actions.
