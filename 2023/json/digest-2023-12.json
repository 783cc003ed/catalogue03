Комбинировать несколько багов и механик для повышения критичности уязвимости тоже можно. Например, XSS на одном домене + CORS-запрос на другом. \n\n👆Чем опаснее уязвимость, тем выше награда.\n\nКонкурс продлится до 31 января: советуем начать пентестить уязы до праздников. У нас уже есть несколько интересных идей на примете. Подробную информацию о наградах смотрите здесь."

На связи Эллиот.\n\nТестирование на наличие уязвимостей SQL-инъекций может выполняться вручную или с помощью автоматизированных инструментов. \n\n— Ниже привёл чек-лист, по которому можно следовать для проверки уязвимостей к SQL-инъекциям:\n\n1. Определите все поля ввода в веб-приложении, включая формы, строки запроса и файлы cookie.\n\n2. Попытайтесь ввести различную полезную нагрузку SQL-инъекций, такие как одинарные кавычки, двойные кавычки и логические операторы, в каждое поле ввода.\n\n3. Наблюдайте за поведением приложения и ищите любые неожиданные результаты, такие как сообщения об ошибках или утечка данных.\n\n4. Используйте автоматические инструменты для автоматизации этих шагов и сканирования веб-сайта, приложения.\n\n👩‍💻 Инструменты для автоматического обнаружения и эксплуатации:\n\n• sqlmap — автоматизирует процесс обнаружения и использования ошибок SQL-инъекций и захвата серверов баз данных.\n\n• SQLNinja — специализируется на поиске уязвимостей SQL-инъекций в веб-приложениях, использующих Microsoft SQL Server.\n\n• Havij — выявляет и использует уязвимости SQL-инъекций в целевом приложении и способен выполнять различные типы атак, включая Blind SQL-инъекцию и SQL-инъекцию на основе времени.\n\n• sqldump — позволяет получить дамп содержимого базы данных или совокупности баз для создания резервной копии или пересылки данных на другой SQL-сервер.\n\n#SQL #Injection #metodology"

Так вот, все эти атаки становятся возможны из-за уязвимостей либо в основном ПО WordPress, либо в плагинах и темах.\n\n2️⃣ Слабые пароли и отсутствие двухфакторной аутентификации\n\nВторая важная проблема безопасности WordPress — это взлом сайтов с помощью брутфорса или ввода утекших логинов и паролей из готовых баз. Так хакер может получить доступ к админке вашего сайта.\n\n3️⃣ Беспорядок с пользователями и правами доступа\n\nСледующая проблема связана с предыдущей: часто владельцы WordPress-сайтов недостаточно тщательно управляют правами своих WordPress-пользователей. Тем самым существенно повышаются риски в случае успешного взлома одного из пользовательских аккаунтов.\n\nВ следящем посте ты узнаешь ещё про две важные уязвимости WordPress-сайтов.\n\nZeroDay | #Угрозы"
