<blockquote>
‼ CVE-2023-43662 ‼

ShokoServer is a media server which specializes in organizing anime. In affected versions the `/api/Image/WithPath` endpoint is accessible without authentication and is supposed to return default server images. The endpoint accepts the parameter `serverImagePath`, which is not sanitized in any way before being passed to `System.IO.File.OpenRead`, which results in an arbitrary file read. This issue may lead to an arbitrary file read which is exacerbated in the windows installer which installs the ShokoServer as administrator. Any unauthenticated attacker may be able to access sensitive information and read files stored on the server. The `/api/Image/WithPath` endpoint has been removed in commit `6c57ba0f0` which will be included in subsequent releases. Users should limit access to the `/api/Image/WithPath` endpoint or manually patch their installations until a patched release is made. This issue was discovered by the GitHub Security lab and is also indexed as GHSL-2023-191.

discourse-encrypt is a plugin that provides a secure communication channel through Discourse. Improper escaping of encrypted topic titles could lead to a cross site scripting (XSS) issue when a site has content security policy (CSP) headers disabled. Having CSP disabled is a non-default configuration, and having it disabled with discourse-encrypt installed will result in a warning in the Discourse admin dashboard. This has been fixed in commit `9c75810af9` which is included in the latest version of the discourse-encrypt plugin. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that CSP headers are enabled and properly configured.

‼ CVE-2023-43652 ‼

JumpServer is an open source bastion host. As an unauthenticated user, it is possible to authenticate to the core API with a username and an SSH public key without needing a password or the corresponding SSH private key. An SSH public key should be considered public knowledge and should not used as an authentication secret alone. JumpServer provides an API for the KoKo component to validate user private key logins. This API does not verify the source of requests and will generate a personal authentication token. Given that public keys can be easily leaked, an attacker can exploit the leaked public key and username to authenticate, subsequently gaining access to the current user's information and authorized actions. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.28.20 and 3.7.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Стрим от KathanP19, посвящённый методологии поиска SSRF уязвимостей в ручном и автоматическом режиме. 

Подделка запросов на стороне сервера (SSRF) - это тип уязвимости веб-приложения, которая позволяет злоумышленнику отправлять произвольные HTTP-запросы из уязвимого веб-приложения на внешний сервер. Приложение может быть обманом отправлено на отправку вредоносных запросов во внутренние системы, что может привести к раскрытию конфиденциальных данных или другим проблемам безопасности.

/ GitLab Critical Security Release: 16.3.4 and 16.2.7

These versions contain important security fixes, and GitLab strongly recommend that all GitLab installations be upgraded to one of these versions immediately.

In short: A stored XSS vulnerability was discovered in GitLab.com that allowed an attacker to inject HTML in any note, issue description, or wiki page by abusing syntax_highlight_filter.rb. The vulnerability was caused by the lack of proper input sanitization. The attacker could inject a script tag by using the base tag and loading the script from their own domain, bypassing the CSP. This could lead to the creation of tokens and take over of SSO accounts.

Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. In versions on the 4.x branch prior to versions 4.0.10, 4.2.8, and 4.2.0-rc2, under certain conditions, attackers can abuse the translation feature to bypass the server-side HTML sanitization, allowing unescaped HTML to execute in the browser. The impact is limited thanks to Mastodon's strict Content Security Policy, blocking inline scripts, etc. However a CSP bypass or loophole could be exploited to execute malicious XSS. Furthermore, it requires user interaction, as this can only occur upon clicking the â€œTranslateâ€� button on a malicious post. Versions 4.0.10, 4.2.8, and 4.2.0-rc2 contain a patch for this issue.

<blockquote>
‼ CVE-2023-42503 ‼

Improper Input Validation, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache Commons Compress in TAR parsing.This issue affects Apache Commons Compress:Â from 1.22 before 1.24.0.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.24.0, which fixes the issue.A third party can create a malformed TAR file by manipulating file modification times headers, which when parsed with Apache Commons Compress, will cause a denial of service issue via CPU consumption.In version 1.22 of Apache Commons Compress, support was added for file modification times with higher precision (issue &#35; COMPRESS-612 [1]). The format for the PAX extended headers carrying this data consists of two numbers separated by a period [2], indicating seconds and subsecond precision (for example â€œ1647221103.5998539â€�). The impacted fields are â€œatimeâ€�, â€œctimeâ€�, â€œmtimeâ€� and â€œLIBARCHIVE.creationtimeâ€�. No input validation is performed prior to the parsing of header values.Parsing of these numbers uses the BigDecimal [3] class from the JDK which has a publicly known algorithmic complexity issue when doing operations on large numbers, causing denial of service (see issue &#35; JDK-6560193 [4]). A third party can manipulate file time headers in a TAR file by placing a number with a very long fraction (300,000 digits) or a number with exponent notation (such as â€œ9e9999999â€�) within a file modification time header, and the parsing of files with these headers will take hours instead of seconds, leading to a denial of service via exhaustion of CPU resources. This issue is similar to CVE-2012-2098 [5].[1]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COMPRESS-612 [2]: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/pax.html&#35;tag_20_92_13_05 [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html [4]: https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-6560193 [5]: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name&#61;CVE-2012-2098 Only applications using CompressorStreamFactory class (with auto-detection of file types), TarArchiveInputStream and TarFile classes to parse TAR files are impacted. Since this code was introduced in v1.22, only that version and later versions are impacted.

Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk View Machine Edition on the PanelView Plus, improperly verifies userâ€™s input, which allows unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code executed via crafted malicious packets. Â The device has the functionality, through a CIP class, to execute exported functions from libraries. Â There is a routine that restricts it to execute specific functions from two dynamic link library files. Â By using a CIP class, an attacker can upload a self-made library to the device which allows the attacker to bypass the security check and execute any code written in the function.

👋 Приветствую в мире цифровой безопасности!

Расскажу про виды угроз, которые подстерегают вас в Сети и не только.

Кибератаки делятся на виды весьма условно. Кроме того, хакеры могут использовать сразу несколько подходов. Тем не менее попробую провести некоторую типизацию:

🟢Вредоносное ПО
🟢DoS- и DDoS-атаки
🟢Фишинг
🟢SQL-инъекции
🟢Атаки на цепочку поставок
🟢XSS
🟢Ботнеты
🟢Брутфорс-атаки
🟢MITM

Обо всех этих кибератаках мы поговорим в будущем.

‼ CVE-2023-39511 ‼

Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The script under `reports_admin.php` displays reporting information about graphs, devices, data sources etc. _CENSUS_ found that an adversary that is able to configure a malicious device name, related to a graph attached to a report, can deploy a stored XSS attack against any super user who has privileges of viewing the `reports_admin.php` page, such as administrative accounts. A user that possesses the _General Administration&gt;Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the device names in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through `http://&lt;HOST&gt;/cacti/host.php`, while the rendered malicious payload is exhibited at `http://&lt;HOST&gt;/cacti/reports_admin.php` when the a graph with the maliciously altered device name is linked to the report. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should manually filter HTML output.

‼ CVE-2023-0925 ‼

Version 10.11 of webMethods OneData runs an embedded instance of Azul Zulu Java 11.0.15 which hosts a Java RMI registry (listening on TCP port 2099 by default) and two RMI interfaces (listening on a single, dynamically assigned TCP high port).Port 2099 serves as a Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) registry which allows for remotely loading and processing data via RMI interfaces. An unauthenticated attacker with network connectivity to the RMI registry and RMI interface ports can abuse this functionality to instruct the webMethods OneData application to load a malicious serialized Java object as a parameter to one of the available Java methods presented by the RMI interface. Once deserialized on the vulnerable server, the malicious code runs as whichever operating system account is used to run the software, which in most cases is the local System account on Windows.

The Media Library Assistant plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion and Remote Code Execution in versions up to, and including, 3.09. This is due to insufficient controls on file paths being supplied to the 'mla_stream_file' parameter from the ~/includes/mla-stream-image.php file, where images are processed via Imagick(). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply files via FTP that will make directory lists, local file inclusion, and remote code execution possible.

** UNSUPPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** ** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** When integrating Apache Axis 1.x in an application, it may not have been obvious that looking up a service through &quot;ServiceFactory.getService&quot; allows potentially dangerous lookup mechanisms such as LDAP. When passing untrusted input to this API method, this could expose the application to DoS, SSRF and even attacks leading to RCE.As Axis 1 has been EOL we recommend you migrate to a different SOAP engine, such as Apache Axis 2/Java. As a workaround, you may review your code to verify no untrusted or unsanitized input is passed to &quot;ServiceFactory.getService&quot;, or by applying the patch from https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/7e66753427466590d6def0125e448d2791723210 . The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release fixing this problem, though contributors that would like to work towards this are welcome.

⚫️ Актуальные инструменты для XSS в 2023 году | Привет, друг. На связи Эллиот.

XSS — «межсайтовый скриптинг» уязвимость, которую можно обнаружить на множестве веб-приложений. Ее суть проста, злоумышленнику удается внедрить на страницу JavaScript-код, который не был предусмотрен изначально.

В этом посте расскажу вам о некоторых тулсах по XSS, которые необходимо знать в 2023 году. Они предназначены для выявления и устранения уязвимостей XSS, в конечном итоге защищая веб-приложения от потенциальных атак.

⬜️ XSStrike — это инструмент, который специализируется на обнаружении и использовании уязвимостей XSS в веб-приложениях. Он предлагает полный набор методов сканирования XSS и полезных нагрузок, что делает его ценным ресурсом для специалистов.

⬜️ Dalfox — это инструмент, который специализируется на сканировании веб-приложений на предмет уязвимостей XSS (межсайтового скриптинга). Это предоставляет специалистам по безопасности и этичным хакерам быстрый и эффективный способ выявления и использования потенциально слабых мест XSS.

⬜️ BruteXSS — это мощный инструмент перебора XSS (межсайтового скриптинга). BruteXSS является кроссплатформенным инструментом, который может запускаться в различных операционных системах.
Такая гибкость делает его доступным для более широкого круга специалистов.

‼ CVE-2023-41054 ‼

LibreY is a fork of LibreX, a framework-less and javascript-free privacy respecting meta search engine. LibreY is subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the `image_proxy.php` file of LibreY before commit 8f9b9803f231e2954e5b49987a532d28fe50a627. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to use the server as a proxy to send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary targets and retrieve information in the internal network or conduct Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks via the `url` parameter. Remote attackers can use the server as a proxy to send HTTP GET requests and retrieve information in the internal network. Remote attackers can also request the server to download large files or chain requests among multiple instances to reduce the performance of the server or even deny access from legitimate users. This issue has been addressed in https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY/pull/31. LibreY hosters are advised to use the latest commit. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions of the 3.x beta branch are subject to a Use-After-Free issue in the `avc420_ensure_buffer` and `avc444_ensure_buffer` functions. If the value of `piDstSize[x]` is 0, `ppYUVDstData[x]` will be freed. However, in this case `ppYUVDstData[x]` will not have been updated which leads to a Use-After-Free vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in version 3.0.0-beta3. Users of the 3.x beta releases are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
