‚Äº CVE-2022-20662 ‚Äº

A vulnerability in the smart card login authentication of Cisco Duo for macOS could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to bypass authentication. This vulnerability exists because the assigned user of a smart card is not properly matched with the authenticating user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring a smart card login to bypass Duo authentication. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use any personal identity verification (PIV) smart card for authentication, even if the smart card is not assigned to the authenticating user.

‚Äº CVE-2022-3215 ‚Äº

NIOHTTP1 and projects using it for generating HTTP responses can be subject to a HTTP Response Injection attack. This occurs when a HTTP/1.1 server accepts user generated input from an incoming request and reflects it into a HTTP/1.1 response header in some form. A malicious user can add newlines to their input (usually in encoded form) and &quot;inject&quot; those newlines into the returned HTTP response. This capability allows users to work around security headers and HTTP/1.1 framing headers by injecting entirely false responses or other new headers. The injected false responses may also be treated as the response to subsequent requests, which can lead to XSS, cache poisoning, and a number of other flaws. This issue was resolved by adding validation to the HTTPHeaders type, ensuring that there's no whitespace incorrectly present in the HTTP headers provided by users. As the existing API surface is non-failable, all invalid characters are replaced by linear whitespace.

An attacker who obtains a JWT can arbitrarily forge its contents without knowing the secret key.

‚Äº CVE-2022-39239 ‚Äº

netlify-ipx is an on-Demand image optimization for Netlify using ipx. In versions prior to 1.2.3, an attacker can bypass the source image domain allowlist by sending specially crafted headers, causing the handler to load and return arbitrary images. Because the response is cached globally, this image will then be served to visitors without requiring those headers to be set. XSS can be achieved by requesting a malicious SVG with embedded scripts, which would then be served from the site domain. Note that this does not apply to images loaded in `&lt;img&gt;` tags, as scripts do not execute in this context. The image URL can be set in the header independently of the request URL, meaning any site images that have not previously been cached can have their cache poisoned. This problem has been fixed in version 1.2.3. As a workaround, cached content can be cleared by re-deploying the site.

‚Äº CVE-2022-39207 ‚Äº

Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. During CI/CD builds, it is possible to save build artifacts for later retrieval. They can be accessed through OneDev's web UI after the successful run of a build. These artifact files are served by the webserver in the same context as the UI without any further restrictions. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user creates a build artifact that contains HTML. When accessing the artifact, the content is rendered by the browser, including any JavaScript that it contains. Since all cookies (except for the rememberMe one) do not set the HttpOnly flag, an attacker could steal the session of a victim and use it to impersonate them. To exploit this issue, attackers need to be able to modify the content of artifacts, which usually means they need to be able to modify a project's build spec. The exploitation requires the victim to click on an attacker's link. It can be used to elevate privileges by targeting admins of a OneDev instance. In the worst case, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, because admins can create Server Shell Executors and use them to run any command on the server. This issue has been patched in version 7.3.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

&#35;technique 

Elevator allows to bypass the UAC and spawn an elevated process with full administrator privileges. This is done by abusing the behaviour of the RPC server that implements the UAC feature, as demonstrated by James Forshaw in his article Calling Local Windows RPC Servers from .NET. The tool does not require to drop an extra DLL or write to the Windows Registry (as is often the case with other UAC bypass techniques), and it has been successfully tested on Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 (it probably works on other versions of Windows).

‚Äã‚ÄãSiofra 

A tool designed to identify and exploit DLL hijacking vulnerabilities in Windows programs. It is able to simulate the Windows loader in order to give visibility into all of the dependencies (and corresponding vulnerabilities) of a PE on disk, or alternatively an image file in memory corresponding to an active process. More significantly, the tool has the ability to easily generate DLLs to exploit these types of vulnerabilities via PE infection with dynamic shellcode creation. 

These infected DLLs retain the code (DllMain, exported functions) as well as the resources of a DLL to seamlessly preserve the functionality of the application loading them, while at the same time allowing the researcher to specify an executable payload to be either run as a separate process or loaded into the target as a module. Additionally, the tool contains automated methods of combining UAC auto-elevation criteria with the aforementioned functionality in order to scan for UAC bypass vulnerabilities.
