‚Äº CVE-2022-37022 ‚Äº

Apache Geode versions up to 1.12.2 and 1.13.2 are vulnerable to a deserialization of untrusted data flaw when using JMX over RMI on Java 11. Any user wishing to protect against deserialization attacks involving JMX or RMI should upgrade to Apache Geode 1.15. Use of 1.15 on Java 11 will automatically protect JMX over RMI against deserialization attacks. This should have no impact on performance since it only affects JMX/RMI which Gfsh uses to communicate with the JMX Manager which is hosted on a Locator.

‚Äº CVE-2022-36037 ‚Äº

kirby is a content management system (CMS) that adapts to many different projects and helps you build your own ideal interface. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of vulnerability that allows execution of any kind of JavaScript code inside the Panel session of the same or other users. In the Panel, a harmful script can for example trigger requests to Kirby's API with the permissions of the victim. If bad actors gain access to your group of authenticated Panel users they can escalate their privileges via the Panel session of an admin user. Depending on your site, other JavaScript-powered attacks are possible. The multiselect field allows selection of tags from an autocompleted list. Unfortunately, the Panel in Kirby 3.5 used HTML rendering for the raw option value. This allowed **attackers with influence on the options source** to store HTML code. The browser of the victim who visited a page with manipulated multiselect options in the Panel will then have rendered this malicious HTML code when the victim opened the autocomplete dropdown. Users are *not* affected by this vulnerability if you don't use the multiselect field or don't use it with options that can be manipulated by attackers. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.1.

<blockquote>
‚Äº CVE-2022-36033 ‚Äº

jsoup is a Java HTML parser, built for HTML editing, cleaning, scraping, and cross-site scripting (XSS) safety. jsoup may incorrectly sanitize HTML including `javascript:` URL expressions, which could allow XSS attacks when a reader subsequently clicks that link. If the non-default `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is enabled, HTML including `javascript:` URLs that have been crafted with control characters will not be sanitized. If the site that this HTML is published on does not set a Content Security Policy, an XSS attack is then possible. This issue is patched in jsoup 1.15.3. Users should upgrade to this version. Additionally, as the unsanitized input may have been persisted, old content should be cleaned again using the updated version. To remediate this issue without immediately upgrading: - disable `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks`, which will rewrite input URLs as absolute URLs - ensure an appropriate [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is defined.

‚Äã‚ÄãGokart

A Static Analysis Tool For Securing Go Code.

GoKart is a static analysis tool for Go that finds vulnerabilities using the SSA (single static assignment) form of Go source code. It is capable of tracing the source of variables and function arguments to determine whether input sources are safe, which reduces the number of false positives compared to other Go security scanners. For instance, a SQL query that is concatenated with a variable might traditionally be flagged as SQL injection; however, GoKart can figure out if the variable is actually a constant or constant equivalent, in which case there is no vulnerability.

Arvados is an open source platform for managing, processing, and sharing genomic and other large scientific and biomedical data. A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Arvados Workbench allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted JSON payloads. This exists in all versions up to 2.4.1 and is fixed in 2.4.2. This vulnerability is specific to the Ruby on Rails Workbench application (√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWorkbench 1√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ). We do not believe any other Arvados components, including the TypesScript browser-based Workbench application (√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWorkbench 2√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ) or API Server, are vulnerable to this attack. For versions of Arvados earlier than 2.4.2: remove the Ruby-based &quot;Workbench 1&quot; app (&quot;apt-get remove arvados-workbench&quot;) from your installation as a workaround.

<blockquote>
‚Äº CVE-2022-35949 ‚Äº

undici is an HTTP/1.1 client, written from scratch for Node.js.`undici` is vulnerable to SSRF (Server-side Request Forgery) when an application takes in **user input** into the `path/pathname` option of `undici.request`. If a user specifies a URL such as `http://127.0.0.1` or `//127.0.0.1` ```js const undici &#61; require(&quot;undici&quot;) undici.request({origin: &quot;http://example.com&quot;, pathname: &quot;//127.0.0.1&quot;}) ``` Instead of processing the request as `http://example.org//127.0.0.1` (or `http://example.org/http://127.0.0.1` when `http://127.0.0.1 is used`), it actually processes the request as `http://127.0.0.1/` and sends it to `http://127.0.0.1`. If a developer passes in user input into `path` parameter of `undici.request`, it can result in an _SSRF_ as they will assume that the hostname cannot change, when in actual fact it can change because the specified path parameter is combined with the base URL. This issue was fixed in `undici@5.8.1`. The best workaround is to validate user input before passing it to the `undici.request` call.

Improper input validation on the `contains` LoopBack filter may allow for arbitrary SQL injection. When the extended filter property `contains` is permitted to be interpreted by the Postgres connector, it is possible to inject arbitrary SQL which may affect the confidentiality and integrity of data stored on the connected database. A patch was released in version 5.5.1. This affects users who does any of the following: - Connect to the database via the DataSource with `allowExtendedProperties: true` setting OR - Uses the connector's CRUD methods directly OR - Uses the connector's other methods to interpret the LoopBack filter. Users who are unable to upgrade should do the following if applicable: - Remove `allowExtendedProperties: true` DataSource setting - Add `allowExtendedProperties: false` DataSource setting - When passing directly to the connector functions, manually sanitize the user input for the `contains` LoopBack filter beforehand.

Shield is an authentication and authorization framework for CodeIgniter 4. This vulnerability may allow [SameSite Attackers](https://canitakeyoursubdomain.name/) to bypass the [CodeIgniter4 CSRF protection](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/libraries/security.html) mechanism with CodeIgniter Shield. For this attack to succeed, the attacker must have direct (or indirect, e.g., XSS) control over a subdomain site (e.g., `https://a.example.com/`) of the target site (e.g., `http://example.com/`). Upgrade to **CodeIgniter v4.2.3 or later** and **Shield v1.0.0-beta.2 or later**. As a workaround: set `Config\Security::$csrfProtection` to `'session,'`remove old session data right after login (immediately after ID and password match) and regenerate CSRF token right after login (immediately after ID and password match)

HackerOne has an internal backend interface that gives debugging capabilities to its engineers. One of the features is the ability to run EXPLAIN ANALYZE queries against a connected database. This feature is accessible by a handful of engineers. The feature is vulnerable to a SQL injection that allows an attacker to escape the transaction that is wrapped around the EXPLAIN ANALYZE query. This SQL injection can be leveraged to execute arbitrary ruby on an application server. This vulnerability will be demonstrated against a local development environment. Proof of concept  go to http://localhost:8080/support/sql_query_analyzer analyze the following query using the public database connection:  ```sql SELECT         1 ; ROLLBACK ; INSERT     INTO         user_versions (             item_type             ,item_id             ,event             ,email             ,object         )     VALUES (         'User'         ,2         ,'update'         , 'uniquekeywordtotriggercode@hackerone.com'         ,'--- username:  ‚Ä¶

<blockquote>
‚Äº CVE-2022-31197 ‚Äº

PostgreSQL JDBC Driver (PgJDBC for short) allows Java programs to connect to a PostgreSQL database using standard, database independent Java code. The PGJDBC implementation of the `java.sql.ResultRow.refreshRow()` method is not performing escaping of column names so a malicious column name that contains a statement terminator, e.g. `;`, could lead to SQL injection. This could lead to executing additional SQL commands as the application's JDBC user. User applications that do not invoke the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method are not impacted. User application that do invoke that method are impacted if the underlying database that they are querying via their JDBC application may be under the control of an attacker. The attack requires the attacker to trick the user into executing SQL against a table name who's column names would contain the malicious SQL and subsequently invoke the `refreshRow()` method on the ResultSet. Note that the application's JDBC user and the schema owner need not be the same. A JDBC application that executes as a privileged user querying database schemas owned by potentially malicious less-privileged users would be vulnerable. In that situation it may be possible for the malicious user to craft a schema that causes the application to execute commands as the privileged user. Patched versions will be released as `42.2.26` and `42.4.1`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

<blockquote>
‚Äº CVE-2022-31195 ‚Äº

DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. In affected versions the ItemImportServiceImpl is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. This means a malicious SAF (simple archive format) package could cause a file/directory to be created anywhere the Tomcat/DSpace user can write to on the server. However, this path traversal vulnerability is only possible by a user with special privileges (either Administrators or someone with command-line access to the server). This vulnerability impacts the XMLUI, JSPUI and command-line. Users are advised to upgrade. As a basic workaround, users may block all access to the following URL paths: If you are using the XMLUI, block all access to /admin/batchimport path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path &quot;/xmlui&quot;, then you'd need to block access to /xmlui/admin/batchimport. If you are using the JSPUI, block all access to /dspace-admin/batchimport path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path &quot;/jspui&quot;, then you'd need to block access to /jspui/dspace-admin/batchimport. Keep in mind, only an Administrative user or a user with command-line access to the server is able to import/upload SAF packages. Therefore, assuming those users do not blindly upload untrusted SAF packages, then it is unlikely your site could be impacted by this vulnerability.

This impacts users that use Shescape (any API function) to escape arguments for cmd.exe on Windows An attacker can omit all arguments following their input by including a line feed character (`'\n'`) in the payload. This bug has been patched in [v1.5.8] which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required. Alternatively, line feed characters (`'\n'`) can be stripped out manually or the user input can be made the last argument (this only limits the impact).

<blockquote>
‚Äº CVE-2022-31109 ‚Äº

laminas-diactoros is a PHP package containing implementations of the PSR-7 HTTP message interfaces and PSR-17 HTTP message factory interfaces. Applications that use Diactoros, and are either not behind a proxy, or can be accessed via untrusted proxies, can potentially have the host, protocol, and/or port of a `Laminas\Diactoros\Uri` instance associated with the incoming server request modified to reflect values from `X-Forwarded-*` headers. Such changes can potentially lead to XSS attacks (if a fully-qualified URL is used in links) and/or URL poisoning. Since the `X-Forwarded-*` headers do have valid use cases, particularly in clustered environments using a load balancer, the library offers mitigation measures only in the v2 releases, as doing otherwise would break these use cases immediately. Users of v2 releases from 2.11.1 can provide an additional argument to `Laminas\Diactoros\ServerRequestFactory::fromGlobals()` in the form of a `Laminas\Diactoros\RequestFilter\RequestFilterInterface` instance, including the shipped `Laminas\Diactoros\RequestFilter\NoOpRequestFilter` implementation which ignores the `X-Forwarded-*` headers. Starting in version 3.0, the library will reverse behavior to use the `NoOpRequestFilter` by default, and require users to opt-in to `X-Forwarded-*` header usage via a configured `Laminas\Diactoros\RequestFilter\LegacyXForwardedHeaderFilter` instance. Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.11.1 or later to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade may configure web servers to reject `X-Forwarded-*` headers at the web server level.

‚Äº CVE-2022-2170 ‚Äº

The Microsoft Advertising Universal Event Tracking (UET) WordPress plugin before 1.0.4 does not sanitise and escape its settings, allowing high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed. Due to the nature of this plugin, well crafted XSS can also leak into the frontpage.

‚Äº CVE-2022-2171 ‚Äº

The Progressive License WordPress plugin through 1.1.0 is lacking any CSRF check when saving its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them. Furthermore, as the plugin allows arbitrary HTML to be inserted in one of the settings, this could lead to Stored XSS issue which will be triggered in the frontend as well.
