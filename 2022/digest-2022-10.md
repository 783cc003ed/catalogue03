SSRF(Server-side request forgery) is a trending vulnerability identified in most web applications in which attackers can cause server-side applications to make HTTP requests to arbitrary domains or subdomains. SSRF-Scanner tool is an automated tool that can find the potential SSRF issues actually from a Infrastructure prospective. 

SSRF-Scanner helps you detect potential SSRF headers and validates the finding it by making a HTTP request back to your server. Actually it support only headers attack but in future versions will also include scanning from an application perspective.

‼ CVE-2022-39350 ‼

@dependencytrack/frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) used in Dependency-Track, an open source Component Analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Due to the common practice of providing vulnerability details in markdown format, the Dependency-Track frontend renders them using the JavaScript library Showdown. Showdown does not have any XSS countermeasures built in, and versions before 4.6.1 of the Dependency-Track frontend did not encode or sanitize Showdown's output. This made it possible for arbitrary JavaScript included in vulnerability details via HTML attributes to be executed in context of the frontend. Actors with the `VULNERABILITY_MANAGEMENT` permission can exploit this weakness by creating or editing a custom vulnerability and providing XSS payloads in any of the following fields: Description, Details, Recommendation, or References. The payload will be executed for users with the `VIEW_PORTFOLIO` permission when browsing to the modified vulnerability's page. Alternatively, malicious JavaScript could be introduced via any of the vulnerability databases mirrored by Dependency-Track. However, this attack vector is highly unlikely, and the maintainers of Dependency-Track are not aware of any occurrence of this happening. Note that the `Vulnerability Details` element of the `Audit Vulnerabilities` tab in the project view is not affected. The issue has been fixed in frontend version 4.6.1.

Vulnerability Overview Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like Remote Method Invocation (RMI), Java Management Extension (JMX), Java Messaging System (JMS), Action Message Format (AMF), Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState, etc. Deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution. Java deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to…

‼ CVE-2022-39311 ‼

GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD helps you automate and streamline the build-test-release cycle for continuous delivery of your product. GoCD versions prior to 21.1.0 are vulnerable to remote code execution on the server from a malicious or compromised agent. The Spring RemoteInvocation endpoint exposed agent communication and allowed deserialization of arbitrary java objects, as well as subsequent remote code execution. Exploitation requires agent-level authentication, thus an attacker would need to either compromise an existing agent, its network communication or register a new agent to practically exploit this vulnerability. This issue is fixed in GoCD version 21.1.0. There are currently no known workarounds.

💥Technical Analysis of Windows CLFS Zero-Day Vulnerability CVE-2022-37969 - Part 1: Root Cause Analysis

An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability may gain SYSTEM privileges. The 0-day exploit can execute the privilege escalation successfully on Windows 10 and Windows 11 prior to the September patch. The cause of the vulnerability is due to the lack of a strict bounds check on the field cbSymbolZone in the Base Record Header for the base log file (BLF) in CLFS.sys. If the field cbSymbolZone is set to an invalid offset, an out-of-bound write will occur at the invalid offset. In this two-part blog series, we will demystify the vulnerability and the 0-day exploit discovered in-the-wild. The blogs consist of two parts: an analysis of the root cause, and an analysis of the exploit. In this blog, we first present a detailed analysis of the root cause for CVE-2022-37969.

​​CVE-2022-40684

Remote Fortinet Code Exeuction vulnerability

On October 7, public reports began to circulate that Fortinet communicated directly with customers about a critical vulnerability in its FortiOS and FortiProxy products. This vulnerability, CVE-2022-40684, has been patched, but Fortinet has not released a full advisory yet via its Product Security Incident Response Team.

Fortinet usually follows a monthly release schedule for security advisories on the second Tuesday of every month, the same day as Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday. At the time this blog post was originally published, it remained to be seen whether Fortinet was going to follow the same schedule for the CVE-2022-40684 advisory.

‼ CVE-2022-39285 ‼

ZoneMinder is a free, open source Closed-circuit television software application The file parameter is vulnerable to a cross site scripting vulnerability (XSS) by backing out of the current &quot;tr&quot; &quot;td&quot; brackets. This then allows a malicious user to provide code that will execute when a user views the specific log on the &quot;view&#61;log&quot; page. This vulnerability allows an attacker to store code within the logs that will be executed when loaded by a legitimate user. These actions will be performed with the permission of the victim. This could lead to data loss and/or further exploitation including account takeover. This issue has been addressed in versions `1.36.27` and `1.37.24`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable database logging.
