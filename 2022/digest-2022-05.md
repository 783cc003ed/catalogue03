In Archibus Web Central before 26.2, multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities occur in dwr/call/plaincall/workflow.runWorkflowRule.dwr. Through the injection of arbitrary SQL statements, a potential attacker can modify query syntax and perform unauthorized (and unexpected) operations against the remote database. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26.2.

Почему всё же следует заклеивать веб-камеру

Люди по-разному относятся к такой вещи, как заклеивание вебки с помощью стикера или банальной изоленты: кто-то смеётся над делающими это, называя их параноиками, а кто-то вполне считает, что вполне разумным будет перестраховаться.

Соучредитель компании EYEO, опубликовал отчёт о работе популярного расширения для браузера Screencastify (популярно у школьников), в котором заявил, что расширение доверяет поддоменам партнёров, незащищённым от популярной уязвимости XSS.

Если говорить более приземлённым языком, то у расширения есть доступ к камере (можно запустить даже без запроса пользователю) и оно перенаправляет трафик через каналы, по которым его можно перехватить. Кажется, что-то подобное уже было в «Чёрном Зеркале».

‼ CVE-2022-29216 ‼

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, TensorFlow's `saved_model_cli` tool is vulnerable to a code injection. This can be used to open a reverse shell. This code path was maintained for compatibility reasons as the maintainers had several test cases where numpy expressions were used as arguments. However, given that the tool is always run manually, the impact of this is still not severe. The maintainers have now removed the `safe&#61;False` argument, so all parsing is done without calling `eval`. The patch is available in versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4.

<blockquote>
‼ CVE-2022-29188 ‼

Smokescreen is an HTTP proxy. The primary use case for Smokescreen is to prevent server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks in which external attackers leverage the behavior of applications to connect to or scan internal infrastructure. Smokescreen also offers an option to deny access to additional (e.g., external) URLs by way of a deny list. There was an issue in Smokescreen that made it possible to bypass the deny list feature by surrounding the hostname with square brackets (e.g. `[example.com]`). This only impacted the HTTP proxy functionality of Smokescreen. HTTPS requests were not impacted. Smokescreen version 0.0.4 contains a patch for this issue.

Flux2 is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes. Flux2 versions between 0.1.0 and 0.29.0, helm-controller 0.1.0 to v0.19.0, and kustomize-controller 0.1.0 to v0.23.0 are vulnerable to Code Injection via malicious Kubeconfig. In multi-tenancy deployments this can also lead to privilege escalation if the controller's service account has elevated permissions. Workarounds include disabling functionality via Validating Admission webhooks by restricting users from setting the `spec.kubeConfig` field in Flux `Kustomization` and `HelmRelease` objects. Additional mitigations include applying restrictive AppArmor and SELinux profiles on the controllerâ€™s pod to limit what binaries can be executed. This vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller v0.23.0 and helm-controller v0.19.0, both included in flux2 v0.29.0
