Version 1.3 and prior are vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `os.path.join` call is unsafe for use with untrusted input. When the `os.path.join` call encounters an absolute path, it ignores all the parameters it has encountered till that point and starts working with the new absolute path. Since the \"malicious\" parameter represents an absolute path, the result of `os.path.join` ignores the static directory completely. Hence, untrusted input is passed via the `os.path.join` call to `flask.send_file` can lead to path traversal attacks. A patch with a fix is available on the `master` branch of the GitHub repository. This can also be fixed by preventing flow of untrusted data to the vulnerable `send_file` function. In case the application logic necessiates this behaviour, one can either use the `flask.safe_join` to join untrusted paths or replace `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` calls.\n\n📖 Read\n\nvia \"National Vulnerability Database\"."

Прячем информацию.\n\n🖖🏻 Приветствую тебя user_name.\n\n•  Стеганография — впервые этот термин упоминался в 1499 году и уже тогда под этим словом подразумевалась передача информации путем сохранения в тайне самого факта передачи. Как ни странно, в наши дни стеганография не получила широкого признания в среде хакеров, хотя нельзя сказать, чтобы к ней не прибегли вовсе.\n\n•  Например, недавно была обнаружена фишинговая кампания, которая была нацелена на зарубежные организации в сфере недвижимости и гос. учреждения. Хакеры использовали сложную цепочку заражений, состоящую из документов Microsoft Word, менеджера пакетов Chocolatey и стеганографии.\n\n•  По классике, атака начиналась с рассылки фишинговых писем, которое содержало документ word с вредоносным макросом. Если жертва открывала этот документ, вредоносный макрос извлекал на ПК изображение, которое скрывает под собой PowerShell-скрипт. Скрипт грузит диспетчер пакетов Windows Chocolatey, который затем будет использован для установки Python и установщика пакетов PIP. Далее в систему жертвы загружается второе стеганографическое изображение для загрузки бэкдора, представляющего собой написанную на Python малварь. Когда скрипт полностью отработает, хакеры получают возможность удаленного управления зараженным устройством: https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/serpent-no-swiping-new-backdoor-targets-french-entities-unique-attack-chain\n\n•  Предлагаю попробовать изучить стеганографию в деле и перейти к практике использования определенных инструментов:\n\n• OpenStego — инструмент имеет поддержку шифрования AES, поддерживает различные плагины и совместим с такими ОС как Windows и Linux. Ознакомиться можно тут: https://github.com/syvaidya/openstego\n\n• SilentEye — софт обладает множеством плагинов и использует современные алгоритмы стеганографии и маскировки. Полное описание: https://achorein.github.io/silenteye/\n\n• imagejs — инструмент можно использовать только в ОС LInux. Однако софт позволяет создать картинки, которые одновременно представляют собой JavaScript - скрипты. Это нужно, чтобы упростить проведение более опасных XSS-атак, в которых иногда требуется подгрузить скрипт именно с атакованного домена. Вот тут на помощь приходит возможность загрузить туда аватарку, которая одновременно содержит JavaScript payload для дальнейшей атаки. Программа поддерживает внедрение в форматы BMP, GIF, WEBP, PNG и PDF. Подробнее: https://github.com/jklmnn/imagejs\n\n• Steghide — консольная утилита, которая скрывает информацию в стандартных файлах форматов JPEG, BMP, WAV и AU. Инструмент умеет не просто упаковывать данные в картинку или трек, а еще и шифровать секретную нагрузку. Ознакомиться: https://github.com/StefanoDeVuono/steghide\n\n• CloakifyFactory — умеет маскировать что угодно не просто в картинках, а еще и в видео, музыке и даже программах. Особенность инструмента в том, что перед маскировкой нагрузки она кодируется в Base64.\n\n•  Настоящие стеганографические утилиты не меняют размер файла. Они «растворяют» скрываемое сообщение по алгоритму LSB или более продвинутому, стремясь сделать распределение измененных байтов неотличимым от наложения случайных шумов. Продвинутые утилиты умеют использовать шифрование, но добавить его можно и самому — например, используя VeraCrypt или тот же RAR.\n\n•  Стеганографию эффективнее всего использовать не вместо криптографии, а вместе с ней. Такое сочетание позволяет скрыть как саму информацию, так и факт ее хранения или передачи. Твой S.E. #Стеганография",

    "message": "Code Review Hotspots with Semgrep\n\nАвтор сегодняшней статьи предлагает поделить сработки на две группы - security и hotspots. Сработки группы security имеют низкий уровень ложных срабатываний и предназначаются для разработчиков, в то время как сработки группы hotspots только свидетельствуют о подрзрении на уязвимость и попадают под ответственность security-инженеров. Вся статья дальше вращается вокруг хотспотов и способов их поиска через инструмент semgrep. К хотспотам относят hardoced secrets, небезопасную криптографию,  мисконфиги,  переполнения буфера и тд.\n\nИнтереснее не сами баги, которые здесь подсвечиваются, а подход в разделении ответственности. Какие правила считать достаточно надежными, чтобы их сработки асайнить сразу на разраба, а не на ИБ?\n\nВ теории можно обратиться к последнему отчету Veracode - State of Software Security v12. В отчете приводится разного рода интересная статистика в контексте сканеров класса SAST/DAST/SCA. В частности, здесь есть перечень CWE, которые лучше всего находятся для того или иного класса сканера (картинка приложена к посту выше). Любопытно, что Cryptographic Issues и Credentials Management относятся к категории уязвимостей, которые гораздо чаще находятся именно SAST'ами, в то время как в вышеупомянутой статье они относятся к хотспотам. Что же делать?\n\nЗдесь позволю себе высказать собственное мнение, как я бы делил сработки на security и hotspots. Для многих оно покажется очевидным. Чем больше уязвимость поддается паттернам, а не механизмам data flow, тем лучше она будет находиться через SAST и тем более уверены вы в ней будете. Сюда относятся hardocded credentials, небезопасный CORS, мисконфиги (в т.ч. Docker / Kubernetes) и другие уязвимости, которые можно допустить, указав в коде непрерывный набор строк кода. SQL-инъекции, XSS, SSRF и прочие уязвимости, подразумевающие прием данных от  пользователя через request-объекты имеют свойства приобретать сложную логику развития, а значит и более высокую степень FP/FN. Нередко, влияние на правила нахождения таких уязвимостей в контексте data flow стоит вам от 3 непрерывных месяцев работы в codeql/checkmarx в соусе из перегоревших appsec'ов. В это же время паттерновые уязвимости довольно легко корректируются с помощью того же semgrep. \n\n#dev #sast",
    "webpage_description": "I will discuss the (not novel) concept of code review hotspots. Hotspots are\nparts of the code that might contain vulnerabilities. They are not suitable for\nautomatic reporting, so security engineers should review them manually. I will\ndefine what I call a hotspot; I'll find some examples with Semgrep; and finally,\nI'll show how I collect these rules.",

Integrators using Composer code to call `VcsDriver::getFileContent` can have a code injection vulnerability if the user can control the `$file` or `$identifier` argument. This leads to a vulnerability on packagist.org for example where the composer.json's `readme` field can be used as a vector for injecting parameters into hg/Mercurial via the `$file` argument, or git via the `$identifier` argument if you allow arbitrary data there (Packagist does not, but maybe other integrators do). Composer itself should not be affected by the vulnerability as it does not call `getFileContent` with arbitrary data into `$file`/`$identifier`. To the best of our knowledge this was not abused, and the vulnerability has been patched on packagist.org and Private Packagist within a day of the vulnerability report.\n\n📖 Read\n\nvia \"National Vulnerability Database\"."

When leveraging the following together: Elide Aggregation Data Store for Analytic Queries, Parameterized Columns (A column that requires a client provided parameter), and a parameterized column of type TEXT. There is the potential for a hacker to provide a carefully crafted query that would bypass server side authorization filters through SQL injection. A recent patch to Elide 6.1.2 allowed the '-' character to be included in parameterized TEXT columns. This character can be interpreted as SQL comments ('--') and allow the attacker to remove the WHERE clause from the generated query and bypass authorization filters. A fix is provided in Elide 6.1.4. The vulnerability only exists for parameterized columns of type TEXT and only for analytic queries (CRUD is not impacted). Workarounds include leveraging a different type of parameterized column (TIME, MONEY, etc) or not leveraging parameterized columns.\n\n📖 Read\n\nvia \"National Vulnerability Database\"."

In PrivateBin < v1.4.0 a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found. The vulnerability is present in all versions from v0.21 of the project, which was at the time still called ZeroBin. The issue is caused by the fact that SVGs can contain JavaScript. This can allow an attacker to execute code, if the user opens a paste with a specifically crafted SVG attachment, and interacts with the preview image and the instance isn't protected by an appropriate content security policy. Users are advised to either upgrade to version 1.4.0 or to ensure the content security policy of their instance is set correctly.\n\n📖 Read\n\nvia \"National Vulnerability Database\"."

SQL Injection vulnerability in entities for applications generated with the option \"reactive with Spring WebFlux\" enabled and an SQL database using r2dbc. Applications created without \"reactive with Spring WebFlux\" and applications with NoSQL databases are not affected. Users who have generated a microservice Gateway using the affected version may be impacted as Gateways are reactive by default. Currently, SQL injection is possible in the findAllBy(Pageable pageable, Criteria criteria) method of an entity repository class generated in these applications as the where clause using Criteria for queries are not sanitized and user input is passed on as it is by the criteria. This issue has been patched in v7.8.1. Users unable to upgrade should be careful when combining criterias and conditions as the root of the issue lies in the `EntityManager.java` class when creating the where clause via `Conditions.just(criteria.toString())`. `just` accepts the literal string provided. Criteria's `toString` method returns a plain string and this combination is vulnerable to sql injection as the string is not sanitized and will contain whatever used passed as input using any plain SQL.\n\n📖 Read\n\nvia \"National Vulnerability Database\"."

A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the file upload facility of the WebUI interface of RaspberryMatic exists. Missing input validation/sanitization in the file upload mechanism allows remote, unauthenticated attackers with network access to the WebUI interface to achieve arbitrary operating system command execution via shell metacharacters in the HTTP query string. Injected commands are executed as root, thus leading to a full compromise of the underlying system and all its components. Versions after `2.31.25.20180428` and prior to `3.63.8.20220330` are affected. Users are advised to update to version `3.63.8.20220330` or newer.

There is a use after free vulnerability in Wasmtime when both running Wasm that uses externrefs and enabling epoch interruption in Wasmtime. If you are not explicitly enabling epoch interruption (it is disabled by default) then you are not affected. If you are explicitly disabling the Wasm reference types proposal (it is enabled by default) then you are also not affected. The use after free is caused by Cranelift failing to emit stack maps when there are safepoints inside cold blocks. Cold blocks occur when epoch interruption is enabled. Cold blocks are emitted at the end of compiled functions, and change the order blocks are emitted versus defined. This reordering accidentally caused Cranelift to skip emitting some stack maps because it expected to emit the stack maps in block definition order, rather than block emission order. When Wasmtime would eventually collect garbage, it would fail to find live references on the stack because of the missing stack maps, think that they were unreferenced garbage, and therefore reclaim them. Then after the collection ended, the Wasm code could use the reclaimed-too-early references, which is a use after free. Patches have been released in versions 0.34.2 and 0.35.2, which fix the vulnerability. All Wasmtime users are recommended to upgrade to these patched versions. If upgrading is not an option for you at this time, you can avoid the vulnerability by either: disabling the Wasm reference types proposal, config.wasm_reference_types(false); or by disabling epoch interruption if you were previously enabling it. config.epoch_interruption(false).\n\n📖 Read\n\nvia \"National Vulnerability Database\"."
