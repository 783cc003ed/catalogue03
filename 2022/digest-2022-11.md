<blockquote>
‼ CVE-2022-24441 ‼

The package snyk before 1.1064.0 are vulnerable to Code Injection when analyzing a project. An attacker who can convince a user to scan a malicious project can include commands in a build file such as build.gradle or gradle-wrapper.jar, which will be executed with the privileges of the application. This vulnerability may be triggered when running the the CLI tool directly, or when running a scan with one of the IDE plugins that invoke the Snyk CLI. Successful exploitation of this issue would likely require some level of social engineering - to coerce an untrusted project to be downloaded and analyzed via the Snyk CLI or opened in an IDE where a Snyk IDE plugin is installed and enabled. Additionally, if the IDE has a Trust feature then the target folder must be marked as â€˜trustedâ€™ in order to be vulnerable. **NOTE:** This issue is independent of the one reported in [CVE-2022-40764](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SNYK-3037342), and upgrading to a fixed version for this addresses that issue as well. The affected IDE plugins and versions are: - VS Code - Affected: &lt;&#61;1.8.0, Fixed: 1.9.0 - IntelliJ - Affected: &lt;&#61;2.4.47, Fixed: 2.4.48 - Visual Studio - Affected: &lt;&#61;1.1.30, Fixed: 1.1.31 - Eclipse - Affected: &lt;&#61;v20221115.132308, Fixed: All subsequent versions - Language Server - Affected: &lt;&#61;v20221109.114426, Fixed: All subsequent versions

​​heap_detective

This tool uses the taint analysis technique for static analysis and aims to identify points of heap memory usage vulnerabilities in C and C++ languages. The tool uses a common approach in the first phase of static analysis, using tokenization to collect information.

The second phase has a different approach to common lessons of the legendary dragon book, yes the tool doesn't use AST or resources like LLVM following parsers' and standard tips. The approach present aims to study other ways to detect vulnerabilities, using custom vector structures and typical recursive traversal with ranking following taint point. So the result of the sum of these techniques is the Heap_detective.

The tool follows the KISS principle &quot;Keep it simple, stupid!&quot;. There's more than one way to do a SAST tool, I know that. Yes, I thought to use graph database or AST, but this action cracked the KISS principle in the context of this project.

Features:
▫️ C and C++ tokenizer
▫️ List of heap static routes for each source with taint points for analysis
▫️ Analyser to detect double free vulnerability
▫️ Analyser to detect use after free vulnerability

‼ CVE-2022-44749 ‼

A directory traversal vulnerability in the ZIP archive extraction routines of KNIME Analytics Platform 3.2.0 and above can result in arbitrary files being overwritten on the user's system. This vulnerability is also known as 'Zip-Slip'. An attacker can create a KNIME workflow that, when being opened by a user, can overwrite arbitrary files that the user has write access to. It's not necessary to execute the workflow, opening the workflow is sufficient. The user will notice that something is wrong because an error is being reported but only after the files have already been written. This can impact data integrity (file contents are changed) or cause errors in other software (vital files being corrupted). It can even lead to remote code execution if executable files are being replaced and subsequently executed by the user. In all cases the attacker has to know the location of files on the user's system, though.

‼ CVE-2022-44748 ‼

A directory traversal vulnerability in the ZIP archive extraction routines of KNIME Server since 4.3.0 can result in arbitrary files being overwritten on the server's file system. This vulnerability is also known as 'Zip-Slip'. An attacker can create a KNIME workflow that, when being uploaded, can overwrite arbitrary files that the operating system user running the KNIME Server process has write access to. The user must be authenticated and have permissions to upload files to KNIME Server. This can impact data integrity (file contents are changed) or cause errors in other software (vital files being corrupted). It can even lead to remote code execution if executable files are being replaced and subsequently executed by the KNIME Server process user. In all cases the attacker has to know the location of files on the server's file system, though. Note that users that have permissions to upload workflows usually also have permissions to run them on the KNIME Server and can therefore already execute arbitrary code in the context of the KNIME Executor's operating system user. There is no workaround to prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. Updates to fixed versions 4.13.6, 4.14.3, or 4.15.3 are advised.

The CAE Learning Space Enterprise management software is vulnerable to a DOM Based XSS attack. 

A DOM Based XSS attack is when a user sends an executed payload to the host and as a result, it modifies the DOM environment in the victim's browser from the original client-side script. 

This attack was found through manually searching burp requests, running tested parameters through a XSS finder tool called Dalfox, then verifying the DOM of the affected host to view the behavior of the application.

Sourcegraph is a code intelligence platform. In versions prior to 4.1.0 a command Injection vulnerability existed in the gitserver service, present in all Sourcegraph deployments. This vulnerability was caused by a lack of input validation on the host parameter of the `/list-gitolite` endpoint. It was possible to send a crafted request to gitserver that would execute commands inside the container. Successful exploitation requires the ability to send local requests to gitserver. The issue is patched in version 4.1.0.

‼ CVE-2022-44784 ‼

An issue was discovered in Appalti &amp; Contratti 9.12.2. The target web applications LFS and DL229 expose a set of services provided by the Axis 1.4 instance, embedded directly into the applications, as hinted by the WEB-INF/web.xml file leaked through Local File Inclusion. Among the exposed services, there is the Axis AdminService, which, through the default configuration, should normally be accessible only by the localhost. Nevertheless, by trying to access the mentioned service, both in LFS and DL229, the service can actually be reached even by remote users, allowing creation of arbitrary services on the server side. When an attacker can reach the AdminService, they can use it to instantiate arbitrary services on the server. The exploit procedure is well known and described in Generic AXIS-SSRF exploitation. Basically, the attack consists of writing a JSP page inside the root directory of the web application, through the org.apache.axis.handlers.LogHandler class.

<blockquote>
‼ CVE-2022-39181 ‼

GLPI - Reports plugin for GLPI Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting (RXSS). Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or emailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.

<blockquote>
‼ CVE-2022-35740 ‼

dotCMS before 22.06 allows remote attackers to bypass intended access control and obtain sensitive information by using a semicolon in a URL to introduce a matrix parameter. (This is also fixed in 5.3.8.12, 21.06.9, and 22.03.2 for LTS users.) Some Java application frameworks, including those used by Spring or Tomcat, allow the use of matrix parameters: these are URI parameters separated by semicolons. Through precise semicolon placement in a URI, it is possible to exploit this feature to avoid dotCMS's path-based XSS prevention (such as &quot;require login&quot; filters), and consequently access restricted resources. For example, an attacker could place a semicolon immediately before a / character that separates elements of a filesystem path. This could reveal file content that is ordinarily only visible to signed-in users. This issue can be chained with other exploit code to achieve XSS attacks against dotCMS.

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Versions prior to 9.2.4, or 8.5.15 on the 8.X branch, are subject to Improper Input Validation. Grafana admins can invite other members to the organization they are an admin for. When admins add members to the organization, non existing users get an email invite, existing members are added directly to the organization. When an invite link is sent, it allows users to sign up with whatever username/email address the user chooses and become a member of the organization. This introduces a vulnerability which can be used with malicious intent. This issue is patched in version 9.2.4, and has been backported to 8.5.15. There are no known workarounds.
