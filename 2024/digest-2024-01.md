üõ† mqXSS 0.2 üõ†

mqXSS is a client to communicate with XSS hooked browsers over MQTT. Similar to xsshunter or beef, mqxss allows interaction with remote browsers that have been injected with a XSS payload. However, instead of having the victim connect back to your server they connect through a Secure Websocket MQTT broker instead. This tool facilitates the JS payload generation and interaction with hooked browsers that communicate over WSS MQTT brokers.

‚ÄºÔ∏èCVE-2023-6551‚ÄºÔ∏è

As a simple library, class.upload.php does not perform an indepth check on uploaded files, allowing a stored XSS vulnerability when the default configuration is used.    Developers must be aware of that fact and use extension whitelisting accompanied by forcing the server to always provide contenttype based on the file extension.    The README has been updated to include these guidelines.

sqlmap is an open source command-line automatic SQL injection tool. Its goal is to detect and take advantage of SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. Once it detects one or more SQL injections on the target host, the user can choose among a variety of options to perform an extensive back-end database management system fingerprint, retrieve DBMS session user and database, enumerate users, password hashes, privileges, databases, dump entire or user's specified DBMS tables/columns, run his own SQL statement, read or write either text or binary files on the file system, execute arbitrary commands on the operating system, establish an out-of-band stateful connection between the attacker box and the database server via Metasploit payload stager, database stored procedure buffer overflow exploitation or SMB relay attack and more.

‚ÄºÔ∏èCVE-2023-6981‚ÄºÔ∏è

The WP SMS  Messaging  SMS Notification for WordPress, WooCommerce, GravityForms, etc plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'groupid' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 6.5 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributorlevel access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. This can leveraged to achieve Reflected Crosssite Scripting.
