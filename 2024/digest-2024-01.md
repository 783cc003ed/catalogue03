🛠 mqXSS 0.2 🛠

mqXSS is a client to communicate with XSS hooked browsers over MQTT. Similar to xsshunter or beef, mqxss allows interaction with remote browsers that have been injected with a XSS payload. However, instead of having the victim connect back to your server they connect through a Secure Websocket MQTT broker instead. This tool facilitates the JS payload generation and interaction with hooked browsers that communicate over WSS MQTT brokers.

🛠 SQLMAP - Automatic SQL Injection Tool 1.8 🛠

sqlmap is an open source command-line automatic SQL injection tool. Its goal is to detect and take advantage of SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. Once it detects one or more SQL injections on the target host, the user can choose among a variety of options to perform an extensive back-end database management system fingerprint, retrieve DBMS session user and database, enumerate users, password hashes, privileges, databases, dump entire or user's specified DBMS tables/columns, run his own SQL statement, read or write either text or binary files on the file system, execute arbitrary commands on the operating system, establish an out-of-band stateful connection between the attacker box and the database server via Metasploit payload stager, database stored procedure buffer overflow exploitation or SMB relay attack and more.
