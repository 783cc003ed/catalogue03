🦅 Major ICS Security Flaws Disclosed in LOYTEC, Hughes, and Baxter Products 🦅

  Key Takeaways      Three major advisories from CISA address 17 vulnerabilities across products from LOYTEC Electronics GmbH, Hughes Network Systems, and Baxter.   Multiple products are affected by vulnerabilities allowing for the cleartext transmission of sensitive data, such as passwords, which could be exploited through ManintheMiddle MitM attacks. Despite being reported in 2021, these vulnerabilities are now publicly disclosed due to the vendor's lack of response.   With 629 internetexposed instances, primarily in Italy and France, the likelihood of exploitation is high. Proof of Concepts PoCs for these vulnerabilities is publicly available.   Other notable vulnerabilities include insufficiently protected credentials and SQL injection, affecting critical infrastructure systems.    ...
